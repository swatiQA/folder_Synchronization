# folder_Synchronization
Python code for folder synchronization
we can schedule the bat file to synchronize the folders at a regular interval.
We could have used sync from dirsync to utilize the method
sync(source_path, target_path, 'sync') #for syncing one way

Here we pass the source and destination folder to copy files and folders in destination and also print/log the count of files and folders updated.
